**Loan Eligibility**: Yes, participant loans are permitted
**Maximum Amount**: $50,000 or 50% of vested balance (whichever is less)
**Current Vested Balance**: $342,000
**Maximum Loan Available**: $50,000

**Key Requirements**:
- Minimum loan amount: $1,000
- Maximum repayment period: 5 years (extended for primary residence)
- Interest rate: Prime Rate + 1% (currently 8.5%)
- Repayment: Automated payroll deduction required

**Important Considerations**:
- Outstanding loans reduce death benefit
- Default triggers taxable distribution
- Cannot borrow if previous loan in default

**Loan Acceleration**: The entire outstanding balance becomes due
**Grace Period**: 90 days to repay in full
**Default Consequences**: 
- Unpaid balance treated as taxable distribution
- Additional 10% early withdrawal penalty if under age 59Â½
- 1099-R issued for tax reporting

**Options Available**:
1. **Full Repayment**: Pay outstanding balance within 90 days
2. **Rollover**: Some plans accept loans - verify with new employer
3. **Continue Payments**: May be possible if plan allows (rare)

**Recommendation**: Contact Harvard Benefits Office before separation to discuss options. Consider loan timing carefully if job change is anticipated.
