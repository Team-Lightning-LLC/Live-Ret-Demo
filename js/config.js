**Current Vested Balance**: $342,000

**Key Requirements**:
- Minimum loan amount: $1,000
- Maximum repayment period: 5 years (extended for primary residence)

**Loan Acceleration**: The entire outstanding balance becomes due
**Grace Period**: 90 days to repay in full
**Default Consequences**: 
- Unpaid balance treated as taxable distribution
- Additional 10% early withdrawal penalty if under age 59Â½
- 1099-R issued for tax reporting

**Options Available**:
1. **Full Repayment**: Pay outstanding balance within 90 days
2. **Rollover**: Some plans accept loans - verify with new employer
3. **Continue Payments**: May be possible if plan allows (rare)

**Recommendation**: Contact Harvard Benefits Office before separation to discuss options. Consider loan timing carefully if job change is anticipated.
